This Claude Code project supports:
- Starting from `prompt.txt` to generate specs and code
- Or using existing `/specs/*.md` to skip planning

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will:
1. Install `context7` and `playwright` MCPs
2. Use either:
   - `prompt.txt` â†’ planner-agent â†’ spec-agent â†’ tests â†’ impl
   - `specs/*.md` â†’ test-writer-agent â†’ impl
3. Launch Claude CLI and hook into the pipeline
